SuperShaper-SOHO

SuperShaper-SOHO is a traffic shaping setup for DSL connections which
prioritizes VoIP and interactive traffic, and makes sure P2P traffic doesn't
saturate your uplink.

Requirements:

    * iproute2 (tc command)
    * HTB enabled kernel (linux >=2.4.20)

IPCop 1.3 and newer is known to work and was the authors primary development
platform. Be sure to disable the integrated traffic shaper in IPCop 1.4 if
you use SuperShaper-SOHO. It is now in daily use with Debian Lenny.
